A significant portion of the film is dedicated to a series of unrelated subplots, most of which involve at least one supporting character, and are unresolved due to the film's inconsistent narrative structure. According to Wiseau, the title alludes to the potential of a room to be the site of both good and bad events; the stage play from which the screenplay is derived takes place in a single room. Sestero has explained that the film is semi-autobiographical, and attempts to serve as 'an advisory warning about the perils of having friends'.</p>",
